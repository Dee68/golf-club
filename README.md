# ASP.NET ASSIGNMENT2 GOLF CLUB DB
## For this assignment, you are requested to write a small web site for a local golf club using ASP.NET(7). 
Using either Razor or Blazor the user of the system should be able to insert, read, update and 
delete golfers’ details. The club’s members are stored with membership number, name, email, sex 
and handicap for each player. In addition to adding members, the system should also allow players 
to book tee times. Tee time bookings are made in 15 minutes intervals from the beginning of the 
hour e.g 9:00, 9:15, 9:30 and 9:45. Only four players may play at the same tee time. The tee 
timetable should store player one, player two, player three and player four names along with their 
handicaps. Members are not permitted to book two games on the one day. 
### From the browser users should be allowed to query the database on the following: 
Member gender 
Handicap golfers below 10 
Handicap golfers between 11 and 20 
Handicap golfers above 20 All 
bookings for a selected member 
Sort : 
  -  Members by Name ascending descending order 
  -  Members by Handicap number ascending-descending 
### Use the SQLServer database for storing members and booking details. Any additional data details for members and bookings are left to your own discretion. Demonstrate validation of input at server and client side.
